=========

An initiative to enable and empower collaborations between citezins and contractors

Under development you should put everything under version control what eventually is needed in production like
frameworks, components etc.

For QA you place everything under the target in a branch. I will upload it after the merge under qa/eu2eu.org.

Finally it will be merged and placed also in a branch into production after the production version is placed in Backup. The acception area will be cleared.
